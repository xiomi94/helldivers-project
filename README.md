# Helldivers Project

I decided to make this page because I am a fan of the game "Helldivers 2" and I liked this topic to do a class project.

The page consists of information about the game and a bit of humor about it.

## Built With

My project is developed with the next technologies:

* [![React][React]][React-url]

## Third party software
