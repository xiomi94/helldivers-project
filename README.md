# Helldivers Project

I decided to make this page because I am a fan of the game "Helldivers 2" and I liked this topic to do a class project.

The page consists of information about the game and a bit of humor about it.

The web is deployed with GitHub and you can visit it clicking [here](https://xiomi94.github.io/helldivers-project/)

You can also read the RSS with some rss reader, for example:

To simulate accessing a mission manager page, a minigame has been created since there is no authentication system. You only have to press the shield button in the footer.
This minigame consists of pressing the arrows on the screen in the following pattern:

- UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT, UP
